### awesome-datascience : [NYC Taxis](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/)

I chose to look at NYC Taxis as the data analysis has the potential to benefit the taxi company, the drivers, and the people traveling. This project focuses around the path of several taxis in 2013, specifically their website has a visualization following a single taxi and all the rides it travels in a single day. Alongside this visualization is key information such as the fares, tax, tips, and how many people took this taxi. An application for this data is analyzing where the most pickups occur so that taxis could be positioned accordingly to maximize profit. This way the taxi company and drivers get an increase in revenue and people could get access to taxis in these areas quicker. We could also discover which areas and trips gave the driver the most tips, for example, is this correlated with  longer trips or is there a stronger correlation with the source and destination points.

_Data Mining for Social Network Data_ analyzes Social Network Data through machine learning in order to answer critical questions that impact the population. I chose this book since I feel there are many interesting questions that can be asked in terms of social network data as social networking sites are becoming more popular and a common place to find people's varying opinions and stances on topics. The spread of false information or 'Fake News' is another major problem in social networks that can have detrimental effects since children are increasing their presence on social networks. Understanding how the information spreads and which people it gets to is important to understand in order to try and keep the spread of misinformation from happening on social networks.
