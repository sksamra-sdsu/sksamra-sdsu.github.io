### awesome-datascience : **NYC Taxis** (http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/)
I chose to look at NYC Taxis because once I saw it as an option I realized the potential the data analysis would have for commercial use by companies to better how taxis operate. This project focuses around the path of a taxi in 2013, the website has an animation following a single taxi and all the rides it travels in a single day. Alongside this visualization, is key information such as the fares, tax, tips, and how many people this taxi took from point A to point B. Some applications of this is we could analyze where the most pickups occur so that taxis could be positioned accordingly. We could also discover which areas and trips gave the driver the most in tips, for example more tips perhaps is as a result of it being a longer trip or a trip where there are more passangers.

I chose _Data Mining for Social Network Data_ since I feel there are many interesting questions that can be asked in terms of Social Network Data as Social Networking sites are becoming more popular and a common place to find people's varying opinions and stances on topics. The spread of false information or 'Fake News' is another major problem in social networks that can have detrimental effects since children are more recently also on these networks.
